# Scraps (LA Hacks 2019)
Creates a world heatmap based on user-uploaded photos of trash and pollution in their local communities.

Google Vision API was meant to scan the photos to verify that trash is present and gather data about the surrounding environment. The API was working with our sample photos, but we were not able to integrate the API into the app in time.

This application was developed at LA Hacks 2019, which lasted 36 hours.

## Tools Used
- Vue.js
- Flask
- Laravel
- Docker
- Google Maps API
- Google Vision API (Did not get working properly)
